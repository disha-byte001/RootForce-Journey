"""
Identity operators are used to check if two variables refer to the exact same object in memory.

- 'is'      â†’ Returns True if both variables point to the same object
- 'is not'  â†’ Returns True if they point to different objects

# First example â€” using funny names to understand the concept ðŸ˜„

ram = [1, 2, 3]
shyam = [1, 2, 3]
rahul = ram  # Ram and Rahul are the same person with a different name (same object)

print("ram is shyam:", ram is shyam)     # False â†’ different objects (even if values match)
print("ram is rahul:", ram is rahul)     # True â†’ same object, just a different name


# Second example â€” using a real coding case

a = [10, 20, 40]
b = [10, 30, 40]
c = a  # c points to the same object as a

print("a is not b:", a is not b)   # True â†’ different objects (even if similar-looking)
print("a is b:", a is b)           # False â†’ different memory locations
print("a is not c:", a is not c)   # False â†’ c is the same object as a
print("a is c:", a is c)           # True â†’ exact same object

# ðŸ’¡ Think of it like this:
# a and c are twins using the same phone ðŸ“±
# But a and b are strangers who bought the same model â€” not the same device!
