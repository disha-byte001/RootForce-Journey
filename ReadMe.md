# 🐍 PythonJourney

This repository tracks my day-by-day learning of Python fundamentals.

I’m sharing my notes, examples, and small practice scripts here as I work through the basics of Python — including topics like variables, data types, conditions, loops, and functions.

## 📘 Progress

- **Day 1**: Introduction to Python, its history, features, and basic theory (no code yet)
- **Day 2**: Coming soon

## 📂 Structure

- `day1/notes.md` → Day 1 theory notes
- `day1/day1-basic/` → Will contain practice code later
- `day2/` → Empty for now

## 🎯 Why This Exists

To stay consistent and document what I’m learning.  
This is a personal log — not a tutorial — but anyone’s welcome to explore or learn along with me.
