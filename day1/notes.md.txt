## 💬 Comments in Python

Comments are used to explain code. Python ignores comments when running the program.

```python
# This is a single-line comment

"""
This is a
multi-line comment
"""
📦 Variables
Variables are like containers. They store data.

Examples:
name = "Disha"
age = 18
You do not need to say the type (like int, string). Python understands it automatically.

🔤 Data Types
Data type are the types of variables
Some common types:

int : for numbers without decimals → 5, 100
float : for numbers with decimals → 3.14, 9.8
str : for text → "hello"
bool : True or False values → True, False

You can check the type using type():

print(type(age))  # Output: <class 'int'>
